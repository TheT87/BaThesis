	abstract = {This paper describes software that examines and reacts to an individual’s changing context. Such software can promote and mediate people’s interactions with devices, computers, and other people, and it can help navigate unfamiliar places. We believe that a limited amount of information covering a person’s proximate environment is most important for this form of computing since the interesting part of the world around us is what we can see, hear, and touch. In this paper we deﬁne context-aware computing, and describe four categories of context-aware applications: proximate selection, automatic contextual reconﬁguration, contextual information and commands, and context-triggered actions. Instances of these application types have been prototyped on the {PARCTAB}, a wireless, palm-sized computer.},

	abstract = {Context is a poorly used source of information in our computing environments. As a result, we have an impoverished understanding of what context is and how it can be used. In this paper, we provide an operational deﬁnition of context and discuss the different ways in which context can be used by context-aware applications. We also present the Context Toolkit, an architecture that supports the building of these context-aware applications. We discuss the features and abstractions in the toolkit that make the task of building applications easier. Finally, we introduce a new abstraction, a situation which we believe will provide additional support to application designers.},

Subsequently, the use of such a model in a Web Engineering process is discussed, including appropriate modeling software, and requirements for a runtime system.},

Although frequently used in cognitive sciences or other disciplines, context stays a very ill-defined concept. Our goal is to identify the main components of the context on the basis of the analysis of a corpus of 150 definitions coming mainly from the web in different domains of cognitive sciences and close disciplines. We analyzed this corpus of definitions through two methods, namely LSA [1], [2] and STONE [3], [4], and we conclude that finally the content of all the definitions can be analyzed in terms of few parameters like constraint, influence, behavior, nature, structure and system.},

A number of attempts to build frameworks for context-aware systems have been made, but these have not provided adequate support for context-aware access control.

	abstract = {As we are moving towards the Internet of Things ({IoT}), the number of sensors deployed around the world is growing at a rapid pace. Market research has shown a signiﬁcant growth of sensor deployments over the past decade and has predicted a signiﬁcant increment of the growth rate in the future. These sensors continuously generate enormous amounts of data. However, in order to add value to raw sensor data we need to understand it. Collection, modelling, reasoning, and distribution of context in relation to sensor data plays critical role in this challenge. Context-aware computing has proven to be successful in understanding sensor data. In this paper, we survey context awareness from an {IoT} perspective. We present the necessary background by introducing the {IoT} paradigm and context-aware fundamentals at the beginning. Then we provide an in-depth analysis of context life cycle. We evaluate a subset of projects (50) which represent the majority of research and commercial solutions proposed in the ﬁeld of context-aware computing conducted over the last decade (2001-2011) based on our own taxonomy. Finally, based on our evaluation, we highlight the lessons to be learnt from the past and some possible directions for future research. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, functionalities, systems, applications, and middleware solutions related to context awareness and {IoT}. Our goal is not only to analyse, compare and consolidate past research work but also to appreciate their ﬁndings and discuss their applicability towards the {IoT}.},

In these emerging ﬁelds, there is a need for computerized systems to have a higher understanding of the situations in which to provide services or functionalities, to adapt accordingly. The literature shows that researchers modify existing engineering methods in order to better ﬁt the needs of context-aware computing. These eﬀorts are typically disconnected from each other and generally focus on solving speciﬁc development issues. We encourage the creation of a more holistic and uniﬁed engineering process that is tailored for the demands of these systems. For this purpose, we study the state-of-the-art in the development of context-aware systems, focusing on: A) Methodologies for developing context-aware systems, analysing the reasons behind their lack of adoption and features that the community wish they can use; B) Context-aware system engineering challenges and techniques applied during the most common development stages; C) Context-aware systems conceptualization.},
