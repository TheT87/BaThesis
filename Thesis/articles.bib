Subsequently, the use of such a model in a Web Engineering process is discussed, including appropriate modeling software, and requirements for a runtime system.},

Although frequently used in cognitive sciences or other disciplines, context stays a very ill-defined concept. Our goal is to identify the main components of the context on the basis of the analysis of a corpus of 150 definitions coming mainly from the web in different domains of cognitive sciences and close disciplines. We analyzed this corpus of definitions through two methods, namely LSA [1], [2] and STONE [3], [4], and we conclude that finally the content of all the definitions can be analyzed in terms of few parameters like constraint, influence, behavior, nature, structure and system.},

A number of attempts to build frameworks for context-aware systems have been made, but these have not provided adequate support for context-aware access control.

The framework includes a context model for classifying and capturing access control-oriented contextual information, a situation model for identifying and defining contextual conditions of concern, and a policy model for specifying context-aware access control policies.},
