	title = {Context-Aware Computing Applications},
	abstract = {This paper describes software that examines and reacts to an individual’s changing context. Such software can promote and mediate people’s interactions with devices, computers, and other people, and it can help navigate unfamiliar places. We believe that a limited amount of information covering a person’s proximate environment is most important for this form of computing since the interesting part of the world around us is what we can see, hear, and touch. In this paper we deﬁne context-aware computing, and describe four categories of context-aware applications: proximate selection, automatic contextual reconﬁguration, contextual information and commands, and context-triggered actions. Instances of these application types have been prototyped on the {PARCTAB}, a wireless, palm-sized computer.},

@article{dey_understanding_2001,
	title = {Understanding and Using Context},
	abstract = {Context is a poorly used source of information in our computing environments. As a result, we have an impoverished understanding of what context is and how it can be used. In this paper, we provide an operational deﬁnition of context and discuss the different ways in which context can be used by context-aware applications. We also present the Context Toolkit, an architecture that supports the building of these context-aware applications. We discuss the features and abstractions in the toolkit that make the task of building applications easier. Finally, we introduce a new abstraction, a situation which we believe will provide additional support to application designers.},

	abstract = {Context-awareness is an essential component of systems developed in areas like Intelligent Environments, Pervasive \& Ubiquitous Computing and Ambient Intelligence. In these emerging ﬁelds, there is a need for computerized systems to have a higher understanding of the situations in which to provide services or functionalities, to adapt accordingly. The literature shows that researchers modify existing engineering methods in order to better ﬁt the needs of context-aware computing. These eﬀorts are typically disconnected from each other and generally focus on solving speciﬁc development issues. We encourage the creation of a more holistic and uniﬁed engineering process that is tailored for the demands of these systems. For this purpose, we study the state-of-the-art in the development of context-aware systems, focusing on: A) Methodologies for developing context-aware systems, analysing the reasons behind their lack of adoption and features that the community wish they can use; B) Context-aware system engineering challenges and techniques applied during the most common development stages; C) Context-aware systems conceptualization.},

	abstract = {This article presents an approach to Web Engineering which aims to account for context-awareness in a comprehensive and integrated fashion, thus enabling an enhanced adaptation of the application to the end-user. A conceptual model, permitting the combination of a domain ontology with context-relevant parameters and a degree of relevance, is presented. Subsequently, the use of such a model in a Web Engineering process is discussed, including appropriate modeling software, and requirements for a runtime system.},
